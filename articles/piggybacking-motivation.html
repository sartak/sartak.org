<p>I'm finally playing Super Mario Galaxy 2 after having been returned my long overdue Wii. I loved the first game to bits and from everything I've heard, this sequel is somehow even better.</p>

<p>But! it's in English and I'm learning Japanese. I could have gotten the Japanese version, but the Wii is region-locked so I'd have to get a Japanese Wii and that is a <em>lot</em> of hassle. Plus, the game isn't exactly chock-full of text, so it's kind of cheating to call playing this studying. A JRPG, on the other hand...</p>

<p>Anyway, so I feel (only a little) bad about playing Galaxy 2 instead of studying. But maybe I can harness my massive desire to play the game by forcing myself to study before playing more. So, what if I demand <b>learning a new kanji</b> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembering_the_Kanji">the method for which</a> I still need to write about) <b>for each star</b>? This would result in lots of kanji learned, since the game has lots of stars. It's also very likely that I will get every star because Mario games are goddamn <em>brilliant</em>.</p>

<p>The only question is: do I have the discipline to pull this off? Let's find out...</p>
