I'm a walker. This one time in Tokyo, I walked a marathon visiting each of the
29 stations of the JR Yamanote line. Stopping only at red lights and a
couple vending machines, it took 10 hours and 21 minutes.

But that's just walking. I could walk forever. Jogging is a _completely_
different beast. I'm not sure I've _ever_ run a mile nonstop before.

On October 9th I started [Couch to 5K](http://www.c25k.com). Day
one alternates 60 seconds of jogging and 90 seconds of walking for 20 minutes.
It could have gone better…

But I kept at it. Other than a hiatus in November because
[reasons](https://twitter.com/sartak/status/669750023027081217), I've run three
times a week since starting. On December 14th I successfully ran the infamous
[week 5 day 3 while traveling](https://www.strava.com/activities/456852459).
(infamous because until that point you've gradually built up to running 8
minutes nonstop… then W5D3 throws you into the deep end with a straight up "jog
for 20 minutes")

Today was the first day of week 8: jog for 28 minutes. That's meant to get you
to about four and a half kilometers. (Week 9 is when the program has you run
5K). But instead of ending at 4.5K, I accidentally ran my very first 5K. I
didn't mean to; I simply stopped after 28 minutes (and change). My [Strava
activity](https://www.strava.com/activities/460953316/overview) shows my
horrible pacing and speed, but, hey. 5K baby!

Onward to 10K!
