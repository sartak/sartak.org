One way to make that button universally useful would be to let you set it up to launch some other application, but unfortunately built-in apps typically don't give you that much rope." };

If that feature indeed lands on the new iPhone, it will save me a couple moments and clicks, thousands of times over, as I flip between iBooks, Anki, and 大辞林 while studying. Also I'm still rocking a third-gen iPod Touch which does not have anything near a retina display, so that'll be great for turning those kanji from muddy to crisp." };
