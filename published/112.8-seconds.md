_T minus several months_, on a whim, I booked travel for a single night in St.
Louis. I would land the night before, and my flight home was five hours
after it was over. The southern half of St. Louis was within the seventy-mile band,
and so I figured I'd show up and do my best on the day of. No further planning
needed. (This incidentally is not my girlfriend's favorite quality of mine)

_T minus one week_, my monkey brain, to feel in control of an absolutely
uncontrollable situation, tells me to constantly refresh three or four sources
of cloud cover forecasts. And tragically it was looking, even up to the night
before, fairly grim in eastern Missouri. That gave me more than a little bit of
anxiety, and I even considered cancelling the trip. But that silly thought was
quickly quashed; a _chance_ to see this is worth the cost. And even if it gets clouded out, certainly I'll still see _something_ interesting.

_T minus twenty-five hours_, welp, no use trying to think about anything else
now. All packed up, on my way to BOS, full of Aussie meat pies. I didn't bring
my Nikon because I didn't want to waste a single moment futzing around with it.
And I knew it would be hard to _not_ find substantially better photos than I
could capture anyway. Traveling with little more than my laptop and two days of
clothing was a nice change of pace.

_T minus seventeen hours_, the check-in staff at the hotel ask "one night? You
must be here for the eclipse! Do you remember what time it will be?" All I can
say back is ðŸ˜¦. I chose to not take them up on the complimentary "honor bar" in
the concierge lounge. I'm already intoxicated over here ma'am! I was greeted
with a lovely sunset which I took to be a good omen.

_T minus six hours_, with the best weather information I could hope to get,
it's time to commit to a solid plan. I'm told this is when the real eclipse
chase begins. Forecasts improved to suggest clouds would _probably_ cooperate
in the St. Louis area. However, there was widespread concern of a uniquely
monstrous traffic apocalypse immediately afterwards. That spooked me into
shying away from points further afield, nearer to the center line. Festus would
get two and a half minutes, sure, but I didn't want to risk trying to make the
46-mile drive back to the airport in "only" four hours. (Though if the weather
suggested a clear Festus but cloudy everywhere closer, you bet your ass I was
absolutely prepared to miss my flight). Since the entire area had essentially
the same forecast, the plan became easy. Just use the light rail to get as far
south as possible. The last stop, in Shrewsbury, would get just over a minute.
And so, with a MetroLink day pass, I headed into the city proper. Paid my
respects to the Arch, which unfortunately was a mess of construction and
fences.

_T minus one hour_, arriving in Shrewsbury, I decided to push forward a little
further still towards the center line. Nearly doubling the duration was surely worth an eleven-mile drive. To hell with the traffic. And so I hailed a ride to Fenton, population 4000. Part of my rationalizing was that Fenton City Park was _just_ close enough that if the worst fears came true I could jog back in time. Probably. My driver almost cried when I gave him my spare eclipse glasses, and I urged him dear god please stay put.

I parked my butt on the grass and watched the sun slowly shrink away. In the
middle of the sky.

_T minus fifteen minutes_, the sun is encased in a thick, dark puff of cloud. However, watching it inch along and subconsciously doing whatever predictive calculus we're all born with, it was looking like it would clear the sun in time with nothing but blue skies in tow. I'm so very lucky and grateful that it did.

_T minus ten minutes_, the quality of light has changed dramatically. These clouds were really just as pink as they look in this photo. The best way I can describe it is that it looked like the white balance on _life itself_ was mis-set. (Also, check out that crescent lens flare)

T minus thirty seconds, that last fingernail of sunlight is disappearing _surprisingly quickly_. Heart racing. It's time.

Totality.

I'm ordinarily a fairly stoic guy. But I'm not too proud to admit I started
bawling my goddamn eyes out _immediately_.

The minute, fifty-two-point-eight seconds passed by so incredibly quickly. I didn't get a chance to see the 360&deg; sunset around me in the horizon. I also didn't get to look for Mercury or Regulus (though Venus made it awfully difficult to not notice her). The sky was either a little too cloudy or too polluted with light to see any stars or the Milky Way. And just as well, I was completely transfixed on totality itself.

Before I knew it, Baily's beads started peeking out. Then the diamond ring. I resisted putting my glasses back on for as long as I could, as the sparkle of the sun grew and grew to push out the complete blackness of the moon.

It was all overwhelmingly spectacular. The most wonderful thing I've seen in my thirty years.

_T minus seven years_, I've started mentally planning the next one.
