title: Google Wave Mania
date: 2009-09-30

<p>I've been on Google Wave since June 11th, thanks to a friend at Google. I haven't been using the account much due to other pursuits in my life. But tonight, since they're rolling to production (I'm in as sartak@googlewave.com), they gave those in the developer preview invitations. Since I know a lot of people are very excited about Google Wave I thought I would be fair and ask on Twitter...</p>

<blockquote>I have google wave invites. DM me if you want one.</blockquote>

<p>Almost immediately I was flooded with random people who have been scouring Twitter for idiots like me.</p>

<p>They also followed me on Twitter because that will help their chances I guess?? (edit: miyagawa pointed out that they did this so I could DM them their invitation)</p>

<p>Of course, friends who saw my tweet pestered me elsewhere too..</p>

<p>I lacked the foresight to turn off the DM-to-cell-phone Twitter notifications.</p>

<p>Dayum... Google really knows how to generate interest.</p>

<p>Update: Oh god it will never end</p>
