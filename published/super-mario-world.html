title: Super Mario World
date: 2010-08-22

<p>I was curious how the Japanese version of Super Mario World was different from what I grew up with, so I played it a little bit. Turns out it's less different than I had expected. Given an in-game screenshot, there's nothing that jumps out at me as being different.</p>

<p>I expected at least one or both of the two words on the screen to have been written as マリオ or 秒/タイム.</p>
<p>When you're on the world map, the level names are in Japanese.</p>

<p>As is most of the rest of the in-game text, especially hint boxes, dialog, and narration. </p>

<p>Remember the Special Zone? You had to unlock it by finding the secret exit in the last level of the already-secret Star World. Your reward for beating this (difficult-to-my-8-year-old-self) Special Zone is a set of graphical changes: a sprite swap of many of the enemies and a slightly different world map.</p>

<p>In English, these levels' names were taken from surfer slang.</p>
<ol>
 <li>Gnarly</li>
 <li>Tubular</li>
 <li>Way Cool</li>
 <li>Awesome</li>
 <li>Groovy</li>
 <li>Mondo</li>
 <li>Outrageous</li>
 <li>Funky</li>
</ol>
<p>I figured I'd play through and see what they originally were. Turns out there are only four names for the eight levels. The first and second level share a name, as do the third and fourth, etc.</p>
<ol>
 <li>おたのしみ　コース (<em>Fun Level</em>)
 </li>
 <li>マリオスタッフもビックリ　コース (<em>Mario Staff Also Surprised Level</em>)
 </li>
 <li>スペシャリストのためのコース (<em>Level for Specialists</em>)
 </li>
 <li>チャンピオンシップのコース (<em>Level for the Championship</em>)
 </li>
</ol>
<p>At the very end of Funky (the last Special Zone stage), you are rewarded with 'YOU ARE A SUPER PLAYER!!' written with coins. I was hoping earning the championship would have netted me a スーパープレーヤだよ！！ or something. But instead it says 'YOU ARE SUPER PLAYER!!' with the 'A' article very much missing.</p>

<p>People I meet sometimes ask how I <em>learned</em> Japanese (yeah, past tense, what?). This blog post forms part of that answer. I'm learning by having fun. :)
