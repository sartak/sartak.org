p { "We reviewed the game together afterwards. I pointed out that several of his moves (e.g. 28, 58, 64) were poorly timed; in each case, we were in the middle of a fight. Each time it let me take a huge advantage. I suggested that a key takeaway from the game is avoid playing away from an active fight. I also pointed out an opportunity he'd lost by connecting unnecessarily on move 48; he could have cut and captured my three stones to make his group alive. Sometimes offense is the best defense." }

My other suggestion for Coby was to learn that basic 3-3 invasion pattern as it will happen frequently." };

p { "My next game I thought I'd heard the tournament director announce a seven-stone handicap for me, but I'm glad I confirmed my opponent's strength, as our rank difference suggests only two stones. I do wonder what would have happened to the tournament if we did play that hugely inappropriate handicap. ðŸ¤”" };

p { "This game was quite exciting for both of us, as we were an even match. I do think Stijn was a bit stronger than me, which worked out well with the handicap." };

p { "After move 18, I quickly became unhappy with my choice of joseki in the bottom left, as it gave white a large left-hand side while my bottom-left corner felt cramped between two groups." };

p { "I wasn't prepared for white's shoulder hit on move 27 after pincering. Even though it's apparently the most common professional move in this situation, I didn't know it. I'm happy with how I improvised though, especially because my first two moves afterwards were also the most common. In the end, by sacrificing two stones, I was able to start to build a framework on the right side, and I left the exchange with sente letting me shoulder hit his third-line stone." };

p { "However as soon as I played that move, 38, I realized this is exactly the sort of game I'd been losing a lot lately: letting my opponent take solid territory while I build thickness, but then not using it effectively. (And sure enough, at the end of the game, my center had been reduced down to only a measly 16 points!) The memory of all those recent defeats is what led me to pull back on move 42, which felt extremely passive and pessimistic." };

p { "White's monkey jump at move 81 surprised me, as it seemed entirely too early to play such an endgame move. But as we played the next few moves out, its value became clear: it was planted as aji to break out into my framework." };

p { "Stijn lamented making a mistake on the sequence of 192-202; he didn't have to give up his four stones. And I made a similarly-sized blunder at move 222. I meant to play the connection between my top-side group and my center group, but instead I put the stone in the wrong spot! I described it later as a *real-life misclick*. Luckily it cost me only nine points; if I had been just a little bit less lucky, a shortage of liberties leading to capture of my top center group would have cost me the game." };

p { "Where I won the game was in managing to secure a large territory on the top side of the board. I was unhappy that I was unable to reduce white's large territory on the left side, but even though it's large, it doesn't make up for the top." };

p { "I played a significant portion of the game with less than a minute on my clock. Several turns, including my final \"pass\" were played with only two seconds left on the clock! However I'd managed to build up over a minute of time after being in countdown, due to a series of obvious endgame moves. And so, despite having only a small pool of time, I felt the game was well-paced. Fischer time does seem to work surprisingly well." };

My plan was to keep her on the defensive by attacking and taking profit as territory (rather than thickness, as I flub that) wherever possible. My first five moves demonstrate this plan nicely. I treated the middle star-point stone as a pincer on both approach-stone groups. And I knew that even though my middle group would be sandwiched, I could lean on one group to attack the other and not be in any danger." };

In such games white's M.O. is to overplay and try to get away with more than is deserved, and so black must be constantly at full attention to call shenanigans." };

p { "Though I certainly did consider kicking the second knight's move approach in the opposite corner, a more ordinary joseki instead seemed prudent."};

p { "By turn 78 it was looking like a great game for me. Graham made five separate groups, four of which were completely sealed in, and the fifth would suffer if it tried to get out. And the rest of the board was looking like it was going to become mine." };

There is a straight line between my rewatching of the famous [\"shape lecture\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKBh8FGK9bU) last week and winning this game. Moves 94, 96, 98, 100, and 116 were directly inspired by the material in that lecture. I'd made Anki cards for many of the shape moves in that lecture's example games, and recalling them here paid off in a big way. (Spaced repetition for Go is a story for another day.)" };

p { "When white (temporarily) shifted from trying to live in the center and invaded on move 125, I was able to relax a little bit. I needed to conserve brainpower for any followup fighting that would again threaten to save the center group, so I played the obvious responses in this corner." };

p { "Move 152 was a pure gote move, much like the one in the previous game, to compensate for the huge difference in rank. While it may not be strictly necessary, I needed to take every advantage in fighting that I could get, due to my reading ability being weaker than Graham's and Eva's." };

p { "The ko starting on move 160 was particularly taxing because any move might lead to a breakthrough allowing white's center group to live. So once the ko began, I *immediately* felt the urge to just give it up. Which was an unusual feeling for sure.
