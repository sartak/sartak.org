p { "I began my Japanese journey on Saturday June 27, 2009. It was then, in Pittsburgh International Airport, that I decided to go to YAPC::Asia in Tokyo. I did not have a passport, nor did I know more Japanese than domo arigato." }

p { "After a few months getting decent at the 92 kana (the Japanese alphabet), and two weeks in Japan, I decided to start learning kanji (Chinese characters). Armed with nothing more than an iPod Touch with the list of the 80 kanji that Japanese first-graders learn, I went to the Boston Common on September 26, 2009 and tried to start learning kanji. I of course flailed around for a bit, but soon (as in a week later) found a good method to learn these thousands of characters." }

p { "I stumbled upon [Remembering the Kanji](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembering_the_Kanji) and it is still, 23 months later, my primary method for learning kanji. It provides a sane order for an adult learner of the ~2000 characters that Japanese students learn. It also guides you through using visual memory to associate the meaning of a character with its constituents." }
