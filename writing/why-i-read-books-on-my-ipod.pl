There will supposedly be a fat home button which allows gestures for easy switching of apps, which will save me a couple moments and clicks, thousands of times over, as I flip between iBooks, Anki, and 大辞林 while studying. Also I'm still rocking a third-gen iPod Touch which does not have anything near a retina display, so that'll be for turning those kanji from muddy to crisp." };
