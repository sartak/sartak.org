The second day Dustin and I walked from the Sky Tree to Ueno, which helped me
to reacquaint myself with Tokyo. I also just *had* to get a DSLR…

I noticed that every time I order by saying 一個 (<i>ikko</i>, one) I end up
getting two (<i>nikko</i>) of the thing. So I've started ordering such things
as 一つ (<i>hitotsu</i>, one) because it sounds nothing like 二つ
(<i>futatsu</i>, two). And by "such things" I mean
[nikuman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikuman)!

Our first stop was the [Tokyo Sky
Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Skytree), the tallest tower in the
world. I'd been a few years ago but it was still very much under construction
(only up to half of its 634 meters).

Unfortunately it was a foggy day so visibility wasn't great. I'll have to come
back next trip; I'd love to see Mt. Fuji from Tokyo!

Next we walked past the <s>golden turd</s> [Asahi Beer
Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asahi_Beer_Hall) and onto
[Asakusa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asakusa).

We walked through an old part of town and I bought the weirdest souvenir for
myself yet. It's a board that restaurants use to indicate whether they're open
or closed. It's now doing just that on my office desk.

Lunch was one of my favorites: [yakiniku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakiniku). I had never seen one serve pineapple before. Genius!

Back at Ikebukuro I went to LABI to buy a DSLR. I ended up with a Nikon D5300. Thanks to the favorable exchange rate, various tax discounts, and it being a Japanese camera, I was able to purchase it for little more than _half_ of what Amazon US charges. I've heard people say it's not worth buying cameras in Japan any more but I'm living proof that Tokyo's still got it!

I was extremely happy I was able to conduct the entire half-hour transaction
entirely in Japanese, including asking useful questions like
一秒で、写真何枚ですか？ (how many photos per second?). At no point did we have
to revert to English, nor did either of us have to use any translation tools. I
can generally articulate my point, if clumsily and circuitously. I couldn't
understand every single word that was said, but I _was_ able to identify the
_important_ words I couldn't understand. For example, when we were talking
about the waiver for consumption tax, I could tell that the important part of
his sentence was the unfamiliar word はんとし (<i>hantoshi</i>). So I just
simply asked what it meant. And it was indeed important: the discount is only
available to tourists staying in Japan for less than _half a year_, which
immediately connected the dots for me, because <i>hantoshi</i> must be 半
(<i>han</i>, half) + 年 (<i>toshi</i>, year).

Fluency is hard to define a priori&mdash;it's a line in the sand&mdash;but this
proves to me that I've achieved it! So worth all the flash cards!

After that was some delicious, delicious
[tsukemen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsukemen). More than any other dish, I
really miss good tsukemen when I'm back home. The noodles have this supremely
slurpy quality to them.

Multiple people suggested to me that I get a fast portrait lens (50mm f/1.8) so
I did the very same night after dinner. Now I've got mad bokeh. Check it!

My phone isn't doing so hot though…
