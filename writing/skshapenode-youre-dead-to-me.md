title: <tt>SKShapeNode</tt>, you're dead to me
draft: 1

For the past three months I've spent every free moment working on my next iOS game. I'm not quite ready to announce it yet, but I figured I'd document one recurring source of pain from [Sprite Kit](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/GraphicsAnimation/Conceptual/SpriteKit_PG/Introduction/Introduction.html).

<tt>SKShapeNode</tt>, how do I loathe thee? Let me count the ways.


From SKShapeNode's [documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/SpriteKit/Reference/SKShapeNode_Ref/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/instp/SKShapeNode/lineWidth), "A line width larger than <tt>2.0</tt> may cause rendering artifacts in the final rendered image."

Wat.
