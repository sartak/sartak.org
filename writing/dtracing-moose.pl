p { "I started by writing this script to load Moose in a loop. Each iteration it forks a new Perl, prints out the process ID, then waits for me to hit enter. This is so I could test loading Moose fresh in a new process and I can attach it to DTrace. There are other ways to do this but this seems the most robust. The script also calls a couple functions that I happened to name `dtrace_begin` and `dtrace_end`, simply so I could zero in on just the Moose load time, ignoring all the other incidental initialization like firing up a new Perl interpreter." };
