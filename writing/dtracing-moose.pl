This is so I could test loading Moose fresh in a new process and I can attach it to DTrace. There are other ways to do this but this seems the most robust. The script also calls a couple functions that I happened to name `dtrace_begin` and `dtrace_end`, simply so I could zero in on just the Moose load time, ignoring all the other incidental initialization like firing up a new Perl interpreter." };

This is just to get a sense of how long it takes to load Moose with some tracing enabled.

So Moose spends 0.23 seconds (about 41% of its total time) apparently waiting for disk. That is a larger percentage than I would've expected, especially because I'm using an SSD. But, there's not much we can do to make disk faster except rely on it less. Let's investigate what else Moose is doing, so further investigations will stop purging the Moose code from filesystem cache." };
