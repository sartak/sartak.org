Weird but completely true story: if you <a
href="https://oeis.org/search?q=sexy">search The On-Line Encyclopedia of
Integer SequencesÂ® for "sexy"</a>, I'm the third hit.

I'm also present if you <a
href="https://oeis.org/search?q=lucky&start=10">search for "lucky"</a>, but
only on the second page.
