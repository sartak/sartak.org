title: A Year of Yunguseng Dojang (or, Deliberate Practice vol. II: Coaching)

For the past year, I have been an extremely satisfied student of the [American
Yunguseng Dojang](https://ayd.yunguseng.com) Go school. It forms one of the
three pillars of my **deliberate practice**. (The other two being flash cards and
memorizing professional games, which I'll address another day)

The school is taught by Inseong Hwang, a [professional-level](http://www.europeangodatabase.eu/EGD/createalleuro3.php?country=%2A%2A&dgob=false) player. Each
week, you play a tournament-quality game, and then you get an _immediate_,
interactive review. There's also a backlog of over a [hundred hour-long
lectures](https://ayd.yunguseng.com/lectures.html) where you can dive more deeply into any specific topic you like. Or
that Inseong recommends specifically for you. And that's an important point
worth emphasizing: Inseong gets to know every student's style, strengths and
weaknesses, quite well. That's what makes AYD so special.

I've been using the ideas of deliberate practice to get the most out of AYD.
This has significantly improved not only my Go ability (which offers lots of
second-order improvements throughout the rest of my life, such as for patience,
moderation, and perspective), but also my approach to learning and teaching any
and all skills.

# My Go Style

Having been a member of AYD for a year now, Inseong certainly knows my style better
than even I do. I'm told I have strong territorial intuition, good strategy,
plenty of knowledge of openings and patterns. And, hearing that, I'm not
surprised: these are topics I enjoy studying. [_Get Strong at Attacking_](http://www.kiseidopublishing.com/Strong.htm#K60)&mdash;a
strategy book about how to take advantage of weak stones&mdash;is by far my
favorite study material.

Although I can plan and implement a strategy, I'm rubbish at tactics. My moves
are not _sharp_. It sure sometimes feels like I'm swinging a wet noodle at my
opponent. I know _of_ lots of tesuji, but I don't _feel_ them in my bones. And
that's what is holding me back. If my tactics could serve my strategy better,
how formidable I would be!

I know this about my Go style because I have an empathetic coach who tracks my
personal progress. Without such a coach, I'm sure I would continue studying the
topics that I already know well, harder and and harder, until I eventually quit
in frustration. But no, my coach has pointed out my shortcomings, and I know
the effort I spend addressing _those_ is worthwhile.

Incidentally, there are _lots_ of parallels to, and takeaways for, my personal
life here. That's part of why I enjoy Go so much.

## Actionable, personalized feedback

Coaches are good not only because they identify your shortcomings, but they can
also design personalized improvement plans to directly address them. Inseong suggests
two ways to address my weakness: study tesuji and tsumego problems to improve
my ability to read ahead, and play many games to build what he calls
"practical experience". I've kept Davies's [_Tesuji_](https://senseis.xmp.net/?TesujiTheBook) always within arm's reach
for a long time now. But I, uh, could do better with the playing games thing. ðŸ˜…

My Go game has evolved and improved a _lot_ thanks to a year of AYD. (I've also
gotten about ten ranks stronger, which is definitely nothing to sneeze at!) My
first shortcoming that needed to be addressed was that I would passively back
down from any fighting. Even when I had a clear advantage and could profit
greatly, I'd roll over and play dead. (Again, some uncomfortable but valuable
takeaways for the rest of my life)

Now, in this game I recently played against someone several levels stronger
than me, I'm certain you wouldn't recognize a player who backs down from
fighting:

(Moves 28, 36, 40, 50, 64, 68, and especially 70, etc, etc, are all quite
assertively stating: you won't be getting more than you are entitled to)

Inseong is good about giving you a very few things to work on. For me,
it used to be backing down from fights. Now, it's sharp moves. For others,
it's studying patterns. For many, it's making sure to spend more than
like, five seconds per move. (As someone who always runs his clock down to
byo-yomi, I really cannot relate)

You'll notice the feedback is not "get better at Go". It's always specific
and actionable.

## Experimentation

Inseong's thoughtful coaching helped me completely squash my problem of backing
down from fights. And I do mean _thoughtful_. If a student tries something that
doesn't work, an average coach would just point out how it doesn't work and
maybe what the right method would have been. But Inseong, like all great
coaches, recognizes the immense value in _reaching outside one's comfort zone_.
Without that, a student won't improve. And so, even a poor
implementation of the right idea earns an AYD student authentic praise.

On the contrary, even though it sure does feel good, winning games doesn't
matter all that much for this particular Go school. You're here to learn. And
to make the most of AYD, or of any coach, a student needs to constantly be
experimenting. Experimentation is not conducive to winning; you can play to
your strengths during real tournament games instead. The concentration required
for focused experimentation can be all kinds of uncomfortable, draining, and
challenging. That's why mastery is so special. (I'm quite delighted by the
newly-popular term "[competence porn](https://www.wired.com/2009/10/admit-it-you-love-competence-porn-too/)"!)

As a concrete example of excperimentation, I played this wedge tesuji in my
game last night. It does _not_ work. Though it's an unexpected tesuji, it won't
help White escape from being surrounded and killed. (It's too late to save it;
my mistakes were earlier). But Inseong said this single move was _so_
meaningful for my particular development, that, even though it doesn't work, I
should get it _framed_. What was important was not the result of the move, but
that I ventured outside my comfort zone. I clearly tried an experiment, to
improve myself. And that was what was important, and made the entire game
meaningful progress for me. Not bad for a single move that didn't work.

## Engineering

I try my best to apply these lessons when I'm the learner, but also when I do
the coaching. I'd been mentoring a friend in software engineering. I encouraged
him to experiment in a one or two _specific_ new ways with each small project
he did. We started with experiments like "separation of concerns" and ended
with experiments like "try modeling this problem using inheritance to pull
complexity out from this other area." I tried to always be on the lookout for
learning opportunities and successes: I pointed out that he'd written his first
closure naturally without even really realizing it, and that blew his mind.
(Closures really have a fantastic API, by the way.) Nothing made me prouder than when he'd nail a layering of abstractions.

My improvements are in the top 5 percentile of the rank changes for all AYD students. So your mileage may vary. But it will vary less if you do deliberate practice!

Maybe I should take on an engineering coach? Branch review?
