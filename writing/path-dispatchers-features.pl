p { "[vti's \"Perl routes dispatching comparison\"](http://showmetheco.de/articles/2011/3/perl-routes-dispatching-comparison.html) originally did not include the routing module that I wrote called `[Path::Dispatcher]`. I'm going to chalk that up to `Path::Dispatcher` not being famous enough, hence this post. I'd like to describe some features beyond those included in vti's comparison, because `Path::Dispatcher`'s design enables some features not supported by any of those other routers." };
